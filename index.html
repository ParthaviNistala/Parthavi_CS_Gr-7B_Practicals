        <p>Round and round the playground,<br>
            Marching in a line,<br>
            I’ll hold your hand.<br>
            You hold mine.<br><br>
            Round and round the playground<br>
            Skipping in a ring<br>
            Everybody loves it<br>
            When we all sing.<br><br>
            Round and round the playground<br>
            That’s what we like:<br>
            Climbing on the climbing frame,<br>
            Riding on the bike.<br><br>
            Round and round the playground,<br>
            All together friends.<br>
            We’re sad, sad, sad<br>
            When the school day ends.</p>
